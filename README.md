### API Integration:
This extremely basic Sinatra CRUD app demonstrates integration of an API into a CRUD app you create. It makes use of the [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API, which is primarily for demonstration purposes.

### Running:
After running ```bundle install```, ```be rake db:create```, and ```be rake db:migrate```, start your server with ```be shotgun``` and navigate to 'localhost:9393/'.
